<h2>Why have you created these visualisations?</h2>

<p>The visualisations have been created as part of the series of advocacy materials for the <a href="http://www.pasteur4oa.eu/">PASTEUR4OA Project</a>. PASTEUR4OA will help develop and/or reinforce open access strategies and policies at the national level and facilitate their coordination among all Member States.
Materials that explain about Open Access policies in a clear way are very helpful for use in disucssions with policy makers.</p>

<h2>What data do the visualisations use?</h2>

<p>The visualisations are primarily built on data from Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies (ROARMAP). A full list of data sets used and their location will be provided.</p>

<h2>Do the visualisations use live data?</h2>

<p>Most of the visualisations use data dumps taken in July 2015. This does mean that they may not be completely up to date. Working with live
data is a lot more difficult and was beyond the scope of this work but there is one live data visualisation <a href="http://pasteur4oa-dataviz.okfn.org/google-map.html">currently available</a>.
 We hope that pointing out the tools and sharing the visualisations will inspire developers to create more services that use open data about Open Access.</p>
 
 <h2>Can I use the visualisations and infographics?</h2>
 
 <p>Yes please do! The visualisations can be embedded in websites and the infographics can be used in documents and presentations. All items are licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons CC-BY licence 4.0</a>.
